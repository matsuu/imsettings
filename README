IMSettings
==============
IMSettings is a framework that delivers Input Method
settings and applies the changes immediately. so it will
takes an effect without restarting applications and the
desktop.

Background
==============
Input Method is used to input some dozens of characters that
can't be represented with ASCII characters, with some
framework such as XIM and SCIM via GTK+/Qt
immodule. particularly which to handle languages that is a
bit complex to do the same thing with the keyboard layout
such as XKB.  In the past, those frameworks has been applied
through the environment variables, such as XMODIFIERS and
GTK_IM_MODULE. and can't be influenced immediately and can't
be without restarting the desktop because of its nature -
it's being inherited from the parent process unless it's
being brought up with the obvious thing from the terminal
say.  Also, there are no such framework to bring up the
necessary process at the run time - of course anyone could
runs it manually though, it's totally out of focus on this
project.

Features
============
* Provide the information of Input Method through IMSettings
* Provide the DBus service to start/stop process of Input
  Method
* Provide the way to apply Input Method to applications
  immediately

Scope
=========
IMSettings may helps when:

* you may want to disable Input Method entirely to use
  features on any applications, which actually can't use
  with Input Method because of the key conflicting.
* you may try another Input Method without closing current
  desktop session.
* someone may wants to borrow your desktop temporarily,
  which uses different Input Method.
* the appropriate Input Methods needs to be installed by
  default regardless of you use, such as Live image.

Supported Toolkits
======================
* GTK+
* LXDE
* Qt
* XFCE
* X (with IMSettings XIM server; require libgxim)

Information files for Input Method
======================================
To make Input Methods available from IMSettings, every Input
Methods that hopes so has to have the information file to
let IMSettings know. those files is usually put under a
directory where you can change the default value with
--with-xinputdir. the filename has to contain .conf or
something that you can also change the default value with
--with-xinput-suffix to avoid listing every Input Methods
that might not work for some languages. Input Methods
doesn't support multiple languages such as XIM doesn't have
to have .conf suffix or so. xim.conf can deals with such
configuration files properly for appropriate languages
according to current locale.

Available parameters
=======================

The following parameters can be described as the shell
environment variables like FOO=BAR in the information file.

* AUXILIARY_PROGRAM=<string>

  An optional program that may want to bring up for Input
  Method, such as the panel and the toolbar and so on.

* AUXILIARY_ARGS=<string>

  A list of command line options for AUXILIARY_PROGRAM.

* GTK_IM_MODULE=<string>

  GTK+ immodule name that want to use.

* ICON=<string>

  An icon file to use in GUI.

* IMSETTINGS_IGNORE_ME=<boolean>

  A parameter to hide Input Method from the inventory. you
  however can still take an action against such Input Method
  via IMSettings.

* LONG_DESC=<string>

  An optional long description to explain what this Input
  Method is.

* PREFERENCE_PROGRAM=<string>

  An optional program that set up Input Method. IMSettings
  itself do nothing on this parameter. but other tools, such
  as im-chooser will take an action for that.

* PREFERENCE_ARGS=<string>

  A list of command line options for PREFERENCE_PROGRAM.

* QT_IM_MODULE=<string>

  Qt immodule name that want to use.

* SHORT_DESC=<string>[:string]

  An optional short description to explain what this Input
  Method is. this variable is also sued for the key to do
  something on IMSettings. e.g. to start/stop Input Method
  and get the information and so on. so this parameter has
  to be unique. for extra option; depends on the backends
  supports though, this parameter is capable to tell
  the backend a sub input method. which may be useful if
  Input Method supports multiple engines.

* XIM=<string>

  This variable is used for XIM. actually it looks like
  XMODIFIERS=@im=$XIM.

* XIM_PROGRAM=<string>

  A XIM server be brought up to communicate through XIM
  protocol.

* XIM_ARGS=<string>

  A list of command line options for XIM_PROGRAM.

Other variables used in xinput.sh
====================================

* DISABLE_IMSETTINGS=<bool>

  If you want to disable imsettings feature entirely, set true. you'll
  miss the feature able to change IM on demand but just need to reboot
  or restart the desktop after changing something.

* IMSETTINGS_DISABLE_DESKTOP_CHECK=<bool>

  If your desktop has XSETTINGS manager support and you're sure it also
  supports imsettings, please file a bug to imsettings. and set true
  temporarily to ignore checking the desktop.

* IMSETTINGS_INTEGRATE_DESKTOP=<bool>

  This affects when Input Method would be brought up. If you
  are sure your desktop system doesn't support XDG autostart
  mechanism, set "no". if you disable imsettings feature,
  this won't affects anything.

Processes
============

* imsettings-daemon

  A DBus service that provide a imsettings facility to
  switch IM processes and gather input methods information.

* imsettings-xim

  A XIM bridge between client applications and real XIM server.

Logging
==========

IMSettings has the logging facility to help for debugging purpose mainly.
Any output from IMSettings and Input Methods is stored into
$HOME/.imsettings.log.
